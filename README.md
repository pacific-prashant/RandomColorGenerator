# RandomColorGenerator
Random Color Generator

ðŸŽ¨ This JavaScript code demonstrates a simple web page interaction where clicking a button generates a random RGB color and updates both the text content and background color of specific elements on the page.

Features:

Clicking the button triggers a function that generates a random RGB color value.
The generated color value is displayed as text within an <h3> element.
The background color of a <div> element changes to the generated color.
The randomColor() function generates random values for red, green, and blue components to create a complete RGB color string.
Usage:

Include this code in an HTML file to create the basic structure of the page.
Attach the provided JavaScript to the HTML file using a <script> tag.
When the button is clicked, the color is updated dynamically based on the randomColor() function.
ðŸš€ This code is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand event handling, DOM manipulation, and generating random colors in a web page context.
